# Weighted-graphs
Implementation of undirected weighted Graph : Data Structure And Algorithms

Author : Eden Shemesh
about the Project:

In This assignment I implemented a Undirected and weighted graphs.

The Project contains 3 Class: Node (implements node_info) , Edge , WGraph_DS( implements weighted_graph) , WGraph_Algo( implements weighted_graph_algorithms)
and 3 interfaces : node_info , weighted_graph , weighted_graph_algorithms
Junit test case : Edge_Test , Node_test
